# Introduction

The geographical distribution of Singapore's population is crucial in urban studies and public policy. Our project examines how demographic characteristics relate to urban planning policies, as illustrated in Figure 1. This visualization, based on data from the Singapore Department of Statistics (2023), highlights significant demographic changes. Commended for its clarity, our work can be enhanced with interactive elements, expanded temporal ranges, and detailed geospatial mappings. These improvements will offer a more comprehensive view of how urban planning impacts population distribution and housing patterns in Singapore.

# Previous Visualisation

# Strengths

The Choropleth map contains several variables: population distribution (quantitative) and planning areas (categorical). Additionally, the visualization includes a heatmap that allow users to delve into subzones to see pattern in land development and population over time.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  Better contrast: Utilize high-contrast colors to improve accessibility for users with visual impairments, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation for all users. One such example is the use of Color Universal Design (CUD) colors which are designed to be distinguishable by all users, including those with color vision deficiencies. ([Okabe and Ito 2008](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/))

2.  Reduced Data Density: Simplify the presentation by reducing the number of data points displayed simultaneously, thus preventing overcrowding and making the visualization more comprehensible.

3.  Interactive Elements: Hovering over a country will display a tooltip with detailed information on the population size of a certain region of Singapore as well as the age profile.

4.  Expanded Temporal Ranges: Introduce options for users to select specific time periods for analysis, facilitating a deeper exploration of trends over time.

# Implementation

## Data

-   Weekly counts of population data by planning area were obtained from the Singapore Department of Statistics. The data includes the total population, age groups, and planning areas for each year. Data Source from ([Singapore Department of Statistics](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data))
-   The geospatial data for the planning areas was obtained from the Master Plan 2019 Planning Area Boundary KML file. Data Source from ([Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/#master-plan))

## Software

-   *dplyr* package is used for data manipulation
-   *leaflet* package is used for creating interactive maps
-   *sf* package is used for handling spatial data
-   *shiny* package is used for building interactive web applications

# Improved Visualisation

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

NOTHING OUR PROJECT IS GOATED

# Conclusion

The plot can effectively communicate the relationship between the population density in each region of Singapore over time, and additionally allow curious readers to explore the data even further using interactivity.
